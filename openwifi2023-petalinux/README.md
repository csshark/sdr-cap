<p>The project is called sdr-cap, it is not my FINAL product it's just name that was put into tests.I'm attaching this directory here for configuration inspiration and to compare files with each other in case of problems when building with <a href="https://github.com/csshark/sdr-cap/blob/main/CORRECT%20readme%20from%20openwifi.md">CORRECT readme from openwifi<a></a>. The most useful file to compare your configuration is in openwifi2023-petalinux/sdr-cap/project-spec/meta-user/conf/petalinuxbsp.conf</p>

<p>I did not upload some of the files that build process has generated because of its size. No less, SDR-CAP provides a petalinux image, but with modified user space.</p>
